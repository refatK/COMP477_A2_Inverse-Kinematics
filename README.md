## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to implement an Inverse Kinematics pass for the movement of a node linked tree. Furthermore, implementation of obstable detection and avoidance of a fixed sized circular obstacle was also implemented.

## How to Run

Since this is a Qt Creator Project, QT Creator IDE should be installed. Once the projected is locally cloned or the source files downloaded, the project can be open using the `A2.pro` file which represents the Qt Project.

##  View Implementation Work

The project started with a given starter code, and the work done can be seen in [this PR](https://github.com/refatK/COMP477_A2_Inverse-Kinematics/pull/2).
